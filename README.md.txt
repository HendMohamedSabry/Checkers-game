I have attached a class project I am extremely proud of. 
This was for a class on Games. The final project involved designing a game that a user could play against a computer AI. I chose to use the minimax algorithm to implement checkers. 
It was a very challenging project, but I am very proud to say that at the end of the semester, I had a fully functional, intelligent game. Of course, having designed the game on an IDE on my laptop, the memory space I had for the minimax tree was not too much, so I could not search very far down the game tree to make decisions. 
Yet, the logic of the minimax is perfect and the computer is able to play in a very intelligent manner. That was my proudest moment of any class in Computer Science I have ever taken. 
The Files are Board.java and GamePlay.java. Board.java initializes the checkerboard and gives the computer the list of all possible moves it can make. 
The other program, GamePlay.java, implements the minimax algorithm and helps the computer make a decision from the list of all possible moves it gets from the board being used and piece placements on it.
This class also contains methods to allow this game to be playable on a browser.
